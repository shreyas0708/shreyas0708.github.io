                I was always facinated by these fancy looking websites of the big firms, they looks so elegent and user friendly. As I grew up i started understanding what it takes to create these websites. Then I learnt that it involves designing and coding, Thus when
                I heard about this course, I was very intrested and wanted to persue this coures. So now I am here finally creating my first website through HTML and CSS from the learnings of this course.
