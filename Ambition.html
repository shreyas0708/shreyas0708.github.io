                Since I was a kid i was facinated by the work and life style of a pilot. Though the studies and the requirements to become a pilot are very tough to attain, it all never matters in front of my passion to become a pilot. Its just an unimaginable feeling
                to fly above the sky and travel to a new place everyday. You get to visit the most exotic places around the world. Here are few of the pilot liscences and the order in which you get them.
